# jetbrains-ide-performance (2020 version)
High Performance Configuration for Jetbrains IDEs [IntelliJ, WebStorm, etc..]

# Motivation

Once you step into the realm of multi-project development, large scale dev, or just have to have like 6 IDE's open. You really start to feel a performance hit on jetbrains IDEs. 

This configuration aims to give at least 10x performance increases across the board. 

# Goals
* Faster Indexing Times
* More Responsive IntelliSense
* Less random freezing or UI lockups
* Better Memory Management
* More multi-threading
* Quicker startup time

# What you need to do

The recommended way of changing the JVM options in the recent product versions is from the **Help | Edit Custom VM Options menu**. To change the IDE options go to **Help | Edit Custom Properties*

For Older IDEs, something like this: `vim /Applications/IntelliJ\ IDEA\ 15.app/Contents/bin/idea.vmoptions`

> * idea.vmoptions --> Help | Edit Custom VM Options menu
> * idea.properties --> Help | Edit Custom Properties

# Minimum Expected Results & Benchmarks
**Note that this example is the orange one (sophisticated)**

# Even More IO Performance
## RAMDISK OSX
If you still want even more indexing and startup performance. Then mounting a RAM Disk and symlinking all caching data is the ultimate powerhouse.
